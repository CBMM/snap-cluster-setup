# Creating first FM for Mathematics (informal & formal)
Idea: train with all mathematical knowledge, both formal and informal. 
But mostly informal first and then use a model that extracts all the formalizable informal statements.
This would be defenitions, theorems, lemmas, proofs, etc. and convert them to formal mathematcs (lean, coq, isabelle).
Then we create the best model that knows all mathematics.
We also train it with all the proof data we can e.g., proof terms, holes, tatic proofs, all type of aligments e.g., proof state <->informalizaiton.
Pruning for high quality data is valuable e.g., with my data aligment/quality/diversity metrics, the kernel, type checker, everything possible, reward models too.
